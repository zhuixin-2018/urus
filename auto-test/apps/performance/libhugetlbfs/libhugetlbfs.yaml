    description: "Build and run libhugetlbfs tests.
                  Runs through $WORD_SIZE bit libhugetlbfs on target system.
                  The default WORD_SIZE is 64 bit to accomodate 64 bit systems
                  but for 32 bit systems the WORD_SIZE value should be set to
                  32 from the json file passed to the scheduler.
                  One needs to run with a kernel that supports huge pages"
